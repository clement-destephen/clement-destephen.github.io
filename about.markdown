TESTeeeev

As a child I got lucky to receive a classical music education. I learned and still play to this day the cello. 

As a young adult I studied engineering and got a master's degree in Digital Signal Processing from the [Institut Supérieur d'Electronique de Paris](https://www.isep.fr/).

I then furthered my education in music technology at the [Center for Interdisciplinary Research in Music Media and Technology](https://www.cirmmt.org/en) at McGill University, and in violin acoustics through a set of conferences organized by [ITEMM](https://www.cirmmt.org/en) / [LAUM](https://laum.univ-lemans.fr/fr/index.html) and various european lutherie schools.

Since 2012 I work as a front-end software instrument developer for [Native Instruments](https://www.native-instruments.com/fr/).

In the past years I've been experimenting with digital music instruments through various musical [projects](https://soundcloud.com/clementdestephen)....

 ...until I more recently got the chance to answer a long-time call from indian classical music. I am currently learning the sitar with [Sebastian Dreyer](http://www.sebastian-dreyer.de/enhome.html).

In parallel I became interested in traditional music instrument building and started the construction of a [viola da gamba](../instrument/building/2022/09/11/viola-da-gamba.html) and a small qanûn.

Since 2017 after various readings about temperament history I began experimenting with string harmonics, electromagnets and the possibilities offered by microcontrollers. One outcome of it is a one string electromagnetically driven [monochord](../instrument/building/2022/09/01/harmonic-monochord.html). I am currently improving the circuit to be able to drive more channels.
