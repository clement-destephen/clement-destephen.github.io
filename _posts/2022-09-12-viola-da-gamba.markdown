A few years ago I started building a Viola da Gamba under the guidance of [Gesina Liedmeier](https://www.liedmeier.nl/home).

The original model is from a 1667 Alt-viola from Henry Jaye.

This project has been absolutely incredible on many levels, from learning the tools and techniques used to build such instruments, to the very long discussions and experiments about acoustics.
