The harmonic monochord is an experiment involving a string and electromagnets. 

I was wondering if it was possible to make a string vibrate at its harmonic frequencies, using tuned electromagnetic fields.

This instrument makes it possible to play the first 16 string harmonics individually, and up to 5 at the same time.

The intensity of each harmonic is changed by sliding your fingers on the small copper elements.

The string vibrations are further amplified by a wooden resonator made with flame maple and beech.
The sound is purely acoustic, not involving any pickup system.

**How it works**

<p>&nbsp;</p>

The electromagnets are driven by pulse-width modulated signals. The concept here is different from the  well-kown E-bows, which are using a feedback-loop. There are a few benefits from using a direct PWM excitation :
- the string enters much faster in resonance
- the string can vibrate at potentially any of its resonance mode or any combination of modes.

The downside being of course that the frequencies must be known by the system, hence the dedicated tuning knobs.
There is one fine-tuning potentiometer per harmonic. They allow a slight detuning of each PWM wave, in order to accomodate for the string natural inharmonicity.

The string itself can be tuned via two pegs, one for coarse and one for fine tuning.

The instrument needs to be powered by an external 15V batterie / AC adapter.
