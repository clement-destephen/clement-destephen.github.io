The harmonic monochord is an experiment involving a string and electromagnets. 

I was wondering if it was possible to make a string vibrate at its harmonic frequencies, using tuned electromagnetic fields.

With this instrument it is possible to play the first 16 harmonics of the string individually, and up to 5 at the same time.

The intensity of each harmonic is changed by sliding your fingers on the small copper half-circles.

The vibrations of the string are further amplified by a small wooden resonator made with flame maple and beech. The resulting sound is purely acoustic, not involving any pickup system.

**How it works**

<p>&nbsp;</p>

It is using simple pulse-width modulated electric signals, unlike the feedback-loop based well-kown E-bows. The PWM signals are generated with a microcontroller and amplified with Mosfets.

The string itself can be tuned via a combination of a piano peg and a violin fine-tuner.
In order to accomodate for the string natural inharmonicity, the individual frequencies of the electromagnet's waves can be further detuned via potentiometers.

All electronics are inside and it can be powered by an external 15V batterie / AC adapter.
